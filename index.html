                <p>Welcome - I'm Dray, a front-end web developer specializing in responsive design and clean, modern interfaces. This site serves as my professional portfolio, highlighting the projects I've built, the technologies I work with, and the certifications I've earned along the way. While I'm currently preparing to begin university, I've already gained practical experience through hands-on coding and client-style projects. I'm actively looking to collaborate with brands, individuals, or teams who value both thoughtful design and reliable development. Let's build something meaningful together.</p>
