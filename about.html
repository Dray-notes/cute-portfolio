                <p>I'm Dray, a front-end developer with a focus on building responsive, user-friendly websites. I recently completed high school and am preparing for university studies in techlogy. In the meantime, I've pursued self-directed learning by completing certifications in Html, Css, JavaScript, UI/UX design, and responsive development. My skills are supported not only by course knowledge but by real project experience - creating portfolio, layout, and interactive elements from scratch.</p>
                
                <p>I'm passionate about building web experiences that are clean, accessible, and visually engaging. i enjoy collaborating with clients and teams to understand their vision and bring it to life through thoughtful design and code. My current goal is to continue growing as a developer while working with others who value attention to detail and user experience. I'm open to freelance opportunities, internships, and creative collaborations - let's connect!</p>
